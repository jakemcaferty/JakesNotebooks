    "\n",
    "## The Vasicek model.\n",
    "The vasicek model is a common interest rate model for pricing interest rate securities.  The model is a very simple Ornstein Uhlenbeck process where $r_t$ is the short rate and $\\bar{r}$ is the average of the historical short rate.\n",

    "* Constant volatility\n",

    "* Possibility of negative interest rates\n",

    "### Extensions of Vasicek\n",
    "* The Ho Lee and Hull White models are essentially extensions of the Vasicek model, but have the added advantage of being able to replicate term structures exactly with additional free parameters ($\\theta_t$ and  $\\sigma_t$).\n",
    "* Hull white is the most flexible, but can be improved by using a two factor model that accounts for level and curvature of term structure\n",
    "* To further improve Hull White, you can add a 3rd factor for the slope of the term structure"
