# These are my Notebooks
This is a general repository for storing jupyter notebooks with general analysis, calculations and models.  My main interests are in financial and predictive modeling.  Ocassionally I may add minor python modules to assist with basic calculations or keep notebooks clean.

### Disclaimer
All the notebooks and work done in this repository are for **educational purposes only** and should not be construed as financial, actuarial or business advice.  

There may be errors in these notebooks as many of them are used as my own personal notes.  I appreciate any feedback or corrections that are offered.
